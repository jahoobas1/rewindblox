THIS is REWINDBLOX V3

This is not how the game is officially organized.
Some used code is not in this repository. If it is not, it should absolutely never change unless Jahoobas changes it.

Updates will happen weekly. Jahoobas will take the code from this Repo and release it under the RewindBlox game.
Nobody gets access to the RewindBlox game file.
No offense to any of you if you're reading this; I just don't trust people very well.

If you are a developer and need to organize this correctly, ask @jahoobas on Discord for a guide.

If you leak the official version of this repo, you will be removed from the development team.
I have the full copyright of all of this code. By developing for JDF, all code written for any of it's projects are our property.

I can, and will file DMCA takedowns against all places this is spread to.

If any RewindBlox code is given out by JDF, this code is now in the free domain and will not be updated.
If that is to happen, you will be told.
